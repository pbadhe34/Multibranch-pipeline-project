Merging via command line
If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a manual merge on the command line.


tep 1: From your project repository, bring in the changes and test.

git fetch origin
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
git merge master


Step 2: Merge the changes and update on GitHub.

git checkout master
git merge --no-ff develop
git push origin master

About pull requests
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
